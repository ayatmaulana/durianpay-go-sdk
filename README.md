# Durianpay SDK for Golang (Unofficial)


## üßê Project Philosophy

> Durianpay is a Payment Gateway that can be used in Indonesia with the support of many payment methods such as VA, Bank Transfer, EWallet, Bank Transfer, Credit Card, and of course PayLater. Not only that, to get to Go Live the process is very easy.
> 
> But it's a shame, besides the API that can be used but there is no Official SDK that has been created and supported by Durianpay, this greatly adds to the workload when you want to use Golang as a language that will be integrated with Durianpay

# üë®‚Äçüíª Library Usage

Here's a brief high-level overview of the Library uses:

- This project uses pure `"net/http"` Golang package for requesting Durianpay API
- For Logging purpose we use Logrus - [https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)
- We use Testify - [https://github.com/stretchr/testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) for test our code
  - And also using httpmock - [https://github.com/jarcoal/httpmock](https://github.com/jarcoal/httpmock) to mocking http request in test


## üå¥ Example
### Create Order
```go
import (
    "time"
    "github.com/ayatmaulana/durianpay-go-sdk"
    "github.com/ayatmaulana/durianpay-go-sdk/common"
    "github.com/ayatmaulana/durianpay-go-sdk/modules/order"
)

...

  payload := &order.CreateOrderRequestPayload{
    Amount: "100000",
    Currency: "IDR",
    ExpiryDate: time.Now().Add(time.Hour + time.Duration(24)),
    OrderRefID: "INV/ORDER/xxxxx1",
    PaymentOption: "full_payment",
    Metadata: order.Metadata{},
    Items: []order.Items{
      {
        Name: "Soap",
        Qty: 1,
        Price: "100000",
        Logo: "",
      },
    },
    Customer: order.Customer{
      CustomerRefID: "CUS/xx1" ,
      GivenName: "Ayat Maulana",
      Email: "myemail@example.com",
      Mobile: "0812345678",
      Address: order.Address{
        ReceiverName: "Hehe",
        ReceiverPhone: "0812345678",
      },
    },
  }

  res, err := dp.Order.CreateOrder(context.TODO(), payload)
  if err != nil {
    // handle error
    log.Println(err)
  }
```

### Create Payment

```go
  ctx := context.TODO()
  res, err := dp.Payment.ChargePaymentVA(ctx, &payment.ChargePaymentVARequestPayload{
    OrderID: orderId,
    Amount: "100000",
    BankCode: payment.BCA,
    Name: "Ayat Maulana",
  }, &payment.SandboxOption{
    ForceFail: true,
  })

```

### Use with Context
```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Duration(time.Millisecond * 10))
defer cancel()

res, err := dp.Disbursement.FetchBankList(ctx)
if err != nil {
  log.Println(err)
}
log.Println(res)
```
